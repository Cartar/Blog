Hi there! Welcome to a few of my favourite things :relaxed: It's just a collection of thoughts and ideas that I wanted to keep. Plus the odd post for you, whoever you are.

## Who am I?
The short answer is a Canadian who loves too many things for his own good. Friends & family, science, philosophy, sports, engineering, video games, coding, self improvement, meditation, cooking, travelling, investing... the pursuit of happiness? You get the idea.

The downside to too many interests is that I'm not the best at anything, BUT, that was never the goal.

## Things I'm proud of
* Canada - summarized well by Tobi LÃ¼tke's article [The case for swagger: Canadians have a lot to be proud of](https://tobi.lutke.com/blogs/news/the-case-for-swagger-canadians-have-a-lot-to-be-proud-of).
* Two years of my life spent learning about the [Theory and Modelling of Light-Matter Interactions in Photonic Crystal Cavity Systems Coupled to Quantum Dot Ensembles](https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/15343) - aka my Thesis title.
* [Juniper](https://junipercreates.com/), a successful Canadian ecommerce service for influencers. I was one of 4 cofounders, but left the company in 2017 to pursuit a career in data science. Juniper's success since then has been due to the cofounders who stayed (and the team they built!), but I'm still very proud for the parts I played. You'll still find me at Juniper events and founder meetings :smiley:
* This blog! I think?

## The long answer...
Fair warning, the remainder of this page is a long answer to the question: who are you? 

Honestly, I don't have a well defined audience in mind. This is probably for future me to see how past me thought about young Will. Or maybe I'll have kids one day and they'll find this an enjoyable read. More likely, you're neither future me, nor an offspring, but maybe you'll enjoy learning a bit more about my life! Or not. That is fine too. I wrote a lot.

#### Growing up :innocent:
I grew up in Toronto (well, North York if you know the difference), in a quietish neighbourhood. I had what I imagine is a normal upper-middle class upbringing. Lots of sports, summer camps, hanging out with friends and playing video games. Both my parents were engineers, working at Ontario Power Generation where they met (they're retired now).

I was good at school, but not uniformly. This was especially apparent pre-high school. I remember in grade 7, thinking my parents only used math and science at work, and so considered other subjects less useful. "Why learn poetry?" I asked my English teacher. "So you can tell girls how much you love them". This asnwer did not fly with me. Who cared about girls?! Well, I did, but no way would I let them know it. 

If English class was hard, French was impossible. I dropped it as soon as I could, which in hind sight, was a bad move. Now 27, I need to learn French in preparation for a sebatical with my bilingual girlfriend in France. 

Math had its challenges, but when I tried, I could usually figure it out. I wasn't the kid who "just got it", but I'm happy about that. I think it taught me empathy, which is a hard skill to refine if you don't struggle in some way. I also learnt that learning is hard, but always possible. And that a good (patient) teacher makes a huge difference.

Finally, I was remarkably lucky to have great experiences at all the grade schools I went to. All 3 were Toronto public schools, 1-6, 7-8, and 9-12 in good neighbourhoods (certainly a factor). Some teachers were more memorable than others, but the biggest impact on my time in grade school, was that my friend group remained largly intact. From about grade 3 onwards, I hung out with the same group of boys, and still have most of them as best friends today.

In grade 12, our group was 8 boys large, and 5 of us all decided to go to Queen's together. So began the next chapter.

#### University :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Math and science drew me to engineering, but I had no idea what kind. I had previously done well in biology and physics, so thought biomechanical engineer would be a good fit. Fortunately, first year engineering at Queen's was a general education, so I had some time to figure it out.

As I researched the 4th year courses available to a biomech eng, none were spiking my interest. However, there was this cool degree: Engineering Physics, with an elecrical option that had 4th year courses like *biomedical physics*. Also, *Laser Physics*! Who didn't want to learn how lasers work? As a final selling point, one of my high school best friends was planning to study Engineering Physics as well. That we'd be living together the next 3 years made it all too easy to pick my major. 

Besides choosing Engineering Physics to be my major, first year showed me the power of teamwork. To do well in engineering, teamwork was necessary. No one could succceed academically (or party) on their own. Queen's eng was a work hard, play hard culture. 

Then came my first 4 months summer, and my first office job. I hated it. The people were wonderful, but they had no work to give me. My average day as the "summer intern" was:

1. Wake up at 7:15
2. Get to work by 9
3. Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - usually the answer was no
4. Complete the work, if any, taking ~ 30-60 minutes
5. Wait until lunch (I had a laptop with internet, but had to look like I was doing things)
6. Ask everyone if they needed my assistance - again, no
7. Wait until 5 so I could leave
8. Get home around 6, eat dinner, relax for an hour or two before bed

I never knew how boring it could be to be paid to do nothing, while needing to be "visible". Truly mind-numbing. There is only so much escape the internet can provide. 

Second year saw my first long term (1.5 year) relationship end. It was entirely my fault. I had been having negative thoughts about the relationship for a few months, but was totally unable to share them out of fear that'd be too hurtful. Instead, I let the emotions bottle up, until one day everything just kind of came out, very much by accident. As I left her house, knowing we'd "broken up" without actually having said those words, I felt freedom. Having been a prisoner of my mind for so long, I forgot how soothing life is when you can share unhappy thoughts openly.

I also learnt some whicked cool math in second year, but that's a conversation for another day. 

The summer between 2nd and 3rd year was the best summer of my life. Possibly enhanced by the contrast to my previous summer, which is a nice little lesson in how cyclical life is. I was a camp instrutor at "Science Quest", a Queen's science camp for kids. 

... taught all day ...
Had fun... anddd ! 

Third year was a wild ride of mind blowing physics (Quantum mechanics is fun when you have a good teacher), and a new, healthy relationship. Over the summer between 2nd and 

Recounting tid-bits from each year. 
- First year a first relationship, new friends, and what to study?
    - Shitty summer job
- Second year was cool math, a break up
    - THE BEST SUMMER JOB
- Third year was crazy physics and a new girl friend 
    - Academia
- Fourth year, another break up, a love of physics & teaching physics 

#### A Masters in Physics :dizzy_face:
Technically, a masters of applied science, which is not to be mistaken with a masters of engineering. Confusing, right?
- Masters was a grind, and other year long relationship & and another breakup
- At the end, entrepreneurship, and getting to the finish line 

#### A start up :hushed:
...

#### Big corporation life with big data :relieved:
- Straddles the world of business & tech
- Love working in teams to deliver value and find cool insights 
- Culture is important 


* I also loved to have discussions, teach, or share new ideas with my friends. Likly, this was a trait I picked up from my Dad, who always taught patiently. I could see how appreciative others were by his patients, and not giving up. When things finally clicked, everyone was better off for it; whether the topic was a discussion or a lesson. 

I'd always liked sharing new ideas, but now I had others coming to me as a teacher. Being a patient teacher was clearly the best strategy, as it led to more eurika moments, and happier participants. 

This was likely a trait I picked up from my Dad, and since first year university, I've continued refining it. 

Being a patient teacher
