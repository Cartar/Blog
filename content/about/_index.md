Hi there! Welcome to a few of my favourite things :relaxed: It's just a collection of thoughts and idea's that I wanted to keep. 

## Whoami
The short answer is a Canadian who loves too many things for his own good. Friends & family, science, philosophy, sports, engineering, video games, coding, self improvement, meditation, cooking, travelling, investing... the pursuit of happiness? You get the idea.

The downside to too many interests is that I'm not the best at anything, BUT, that was never the goal.

## The long answer
#### Chapter 1: Toronto
I grew up in Toronto (North York actually, if you know the difference), in a quietish neighbourhood. The classic upper-middle class upbringing. Lots of sports, summer camps, hanging out with friends and playing video games. Both my parents worked at Ontario Power Generation where they met. Both of them engineers, which likely influenced both my aptitude and appreciation for science and math. As a kid, I wasn't very good with languages, and thought those subjects less useful when compared to math and science. After all, you could build things if you understood math and science, but who cares about poetry? Of course these days, I'm always trying to improve my communication and wish I'd appreciated languages more. I suppose it's natural for kids to dislike what they're bad at. 

A funny thing happened in high school. Suddenly, marks mattered, and I became good at school. I'd always been competative, so knowing I could "win", made a big difference. I also had a secret weapon. Actually, I had a few. My friend group was an odd mix of gifted kids, who liked to play more than work. So when grades finally started to matter, we'd study together and ace the tests. This is when I realized that efficient teamwork made me a better person. Three hours as a team, we could solve things that'd take me at least twice as long on my own. 

Then came the big decision, what University do we all go to? One by one, we made our decisions. I'm not sure how much our decisions were influenced by each other, but in the end, most of the boys decided on Queen's. Five out of eight, all off to same new city. And of course, we were going to live together in second year. 

... What to study... Verde's help ...

#### Chapter 2: Kingston
Recounting tid-bits from each year. 
- First year a first relationship, new friends, and what to study?
    - Shitty summer job
- Second year was cool math, a break up
    - THE BEST SUMMER JOB
- Third year was crazy physics and a new girl friend 
    - Academia
- Fourth year, another break up, a love of physics & teaching physics 

- Masters was a grind, and other year long relationship & and another breakup
- At the end, entrepreneurship, and getting to the finish line 

#### Chapter 3: Vancouver 
...

#### Chapter 4: Building my Career in Data
- Straddles the world of business & tech
- Love working in teams to deliver value and find cool insights 
- Culture is important
