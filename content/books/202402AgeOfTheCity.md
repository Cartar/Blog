Even as someone who isn't a city planner, I found many of the chapters somewhat obvious. The challenge of climate change in cities, or increased risk of novel viruses for example. However, I did enjoy the book; not dissimilar to a good economist article, the ideas were well written, and the story easy to follow. Just not enough "Aha" moments I suppose.

3/5.
