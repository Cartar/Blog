A bit dated, this book remains a captivating story of the human condition. Seeking an outcome for fulfillment:

> "It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace."

the story takes the reader through relatable ups-and-downs, occasional magic, and a satisfying ending.

4/5.
