The cover of this book says: "wildly imaginative", which is a perfect synopsys. I've not had my mind blow so many times over by a series, and I doubt I ever will again. It isn't just the exotic physics of higher dimensions utilized by hyper advanced civilizations. It is the political interactions of those civilizations with one another, and a story arc that is truly captivating. I felt the full range of emotions in this book - from excitedly anticipating reunions, to battles outcomes, mind games, and love stories. This book had it all. I cannot recommend this book, or this series enough. The only downside is that the books are a little long, and take ~50-100 pages to really get into. But once you're there, the length of the story becomes a blessing, as you'll not want the ride to end.

5/5.
