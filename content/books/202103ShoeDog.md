A novel that'll transport you back to a decade quite unlike today. Not only was there no Nike, there wasn't "athleisure" or jogging for fun. The story on it's own is hard to put down, but the way it's told makes this a truly joyful read.

# Bookmarked ideas

* "Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results."
* "[To help young entrepreneurs,] I'd tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I'd tell men and women in their mid twenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don't know what that means, seek it. If you're following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointment will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you've ever felt."

5/5.
