An insightful perspective on our society today, the author weaves stories of addiction throughout to illustrate how we're easily prone to it, and how we might pull ourselves out.

The most insightful lesson (for me) was that pain is in fact a pleasurable time-sink, due to the pleasure-pain balance our bodies strive for. Post pain, we are often flooded with euphoric hormones to compensate. Beware of becoming addicted to pain, but, when used correctly, it is a low risk powerful stimulant.

Examples can include: cold water sessions (I'd argue hot ones too), physical activity, caloric restriction (careful for adverse health effects), and learning something new.

I'll add that in our high-speed dopamine-saturated society, slow activities like yoga, meditation, and aimless mind wandering can feel painful if you're addicted to delivering results (which itself is an addiction to pain mechanism). Over time, leaning into these activities will deliver healthier pleasure too.

Everything in moderation.

5/5.
