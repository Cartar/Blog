I found the narrative a little hard to follow at first, but by the end, I was hooked. This sci-fi adventure is inventive in the creation of the antagonist, and keeps you wanting to learn more about their story. Having not read any literature from China before, I found there to a weight behind the backstory that was new to me. The author spoke of cultural revolution in China in a way that was unexpected, and captivating. I'm excited to read the next 2 parts of the adventure!

4/5.
