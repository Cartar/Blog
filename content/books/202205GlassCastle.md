A memoir of an extraordinary childhood; one where quotes like "I'd gotten pretty good at shooting the revolver by the time I was 4" is but the tip of the iceberg. Parents who disliked "the system", and thought their misfortunes were adventures to be had. Hard times were simply hard lessons, but not worth fussing over. A true look behind the curtain at some of America's forgotten people.

4/5.
