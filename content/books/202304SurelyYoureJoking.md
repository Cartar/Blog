This collection of stories from Richard Feynman's life is a fascinating time capsule into life in the mid 1900's. From his work on the Manhattan Project, to his inquisitive mind and child-like love of life, he truly is a magnificent character whose voice and adventures shine bright in this book.

4/5.
