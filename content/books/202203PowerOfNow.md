A book about spirituality accessed by focusing your attention on the present. Written in the late 90's, this book seems ahead of its time regarding the power of mindfulness. However, the author extends the benefits of mindfulness into the mystical realm of God, which might resonate with some folks, but harder for an atheist (like me) to digest.

3/5.
