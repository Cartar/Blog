Oh boy, this book wasn't so much anything new, as it was a compelling reminder to eat whole foods, or at the very least, purchase food who's full list of ingredients you'd have at home. There is a slow, but steady, understanding of these so-called Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs), and their negative health implications.

I had an inkling about it beforehand, but I had thought the problem stemmed from a low fiber, high in fats, sugar, and salt diet that often goes hand-in-hand with UPFs. However, that isn't it. When controlling for these variables, recent studies have still found negative health outcomes of ~25% increase risks for a whole host of diseases and cancers - including alzheimers! Clearly, there is something unnatural about these ingredients that interact negatively with our bodies.

The catch is, these UPFs are cheap, and pervasive. They've done well to deflect blame to poor eating habits, and align themselves with present day nutritional guidelines published by various governments. So although the packaging of these prepared snacks or meals might look healthy on the outside (think of cereal labels claiming high fiber, low salt / fat, high vitamins, etc.), they're actually made with the help of UPFs. So eating a diet free of UPFs is quite challenging, and expensive.

Everything in moderation is probably true, but best to try and avoid these foods.

4/5.
