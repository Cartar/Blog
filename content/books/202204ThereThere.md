Some beautifully written passages that were thought provoking in the way good poetry often is; however the book overall wasn't as captivating of a story as I'd hoped.

Unique storytelling in how the chapters were constructed, but I found it hard to build up empathy for any one character, and found myself loosing steam in the middle.

The conclusion however was worthwhile.

3/5.
