Very engaging book, regardless of your understanding on the topic. In addition to learning about the power of habits, you'll also learn to recognize what parts of your life are good/bad habits and how to build/break them.

It's a very good framework for everyone to be aware of, regardless of you goals. Best of all, this book keeps you engaged from chapter 1 with well told anecdotes and analogies.

## My takeaways:

1. Small changes often appear to make no differnece, until you've crossed some critical threshold. A halmark feature of compounding gains. You need to be patient.
2. To improve your results, focus on your system, not the goals themselves.
3. To improve your system, focus on your identity. You become your habits. Therefore, changing your habits requires you to change your identity. Are you someone who wants to do X, or are you someone who is doing X?
4. Any habit can be broken down into a 4-step feedback loop: que, craving, response, and reward. To effectively change behaviour, simply target one of the 4 parts of the feedback loop: i) make it obvious; ii) make it attractive; iii) make it easy; iv) make it satisfying.

### Make it obvious
* To make behaviour change always starts with awareness. You need to recognize your habits, before you can change them.
* Habit scorecare: review of your daily habits and categorize them into -/=/+
* Point & call the action to make it clear what is happening & it's consequence. I.e., I am opening a new tab and typing "r" out of habit, this will take me to reddit if I press enter where I'll have some fun but likely spend too much time and regret having come in the first place.
