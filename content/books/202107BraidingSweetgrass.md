Note: I only read ~50% of this book. I wasn't captivated by the content my first time through, which might be why I only rated this a 3/5. I should like to try again one day, as I know many people who say this is one of their favourite books.

Stories of indigenous wisdom, woven with scientific thinking, told in a North American setting. Many beautiful lessons to be had here, like how our language shapes our relationship with the environment. For example, the personification of nature in indigenous tongues, and the naturefication of human actions is indicative of their relationship.

Other lessons include regenerative farming techniques, deep respect for the land and ecosystem you depend on, spending time in nature, and the mystery of pecan trees who drop all their nuts at the same time as if in contact with one another.

3/5.
