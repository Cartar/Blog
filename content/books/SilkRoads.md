This book is a massive undertaking that constructs the why behind our current situation. History has many authors, and this book does well to capture their idea's in a cohesive framework. That the pipeline of resources, starting with the silk road, has been the major thread in our world history. 

The book starts off slow, but is worth perservering through the begging chapter's many names, dates, regions and wars. It starts about 2000 years ago, following the quest for resource dominance. In the first millenia, these resources are luxury goods like silk, spices, or tea, along with military equiptment, horses and slaves. Sharing of the luxury goods to a select inner circle keep them content as they oversee mass inequality.

## My main take aways
History lessons:
* How a world with hundreds of religions is reduced to a few 
* Why the middle east is a hotbed for endless fighting
* The luck involved to create a golden era 
    * How quickly that era falls when the KingPin dies
* The human cost required to sustain an empire

And most importantly, **how frequently history repeats itself**.
