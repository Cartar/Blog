Going through a recession will never be quite the same again after reading this diary. Strange to see how many similarities exist in stock markets in such a different setting in time.

Humans love to speculate, and are quick to become greedy when the party is pumping. Those who like to party a little too hardy, leveraging their gains as collateral to buy more stock on margin, are almost always wiped out sooner or later.

This diary has many such stories, and describes the news of the day as if it was yesterday. An interesting way to hear about life in the 1930's and the start of WW2.

3/5.
