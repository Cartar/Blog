For those unfamiliar with how impactful luck is in our lives, this book is an eye opener. Malcolm sheds light on how societal outliers achieved (or failed to achieve) greatness, and the role of luck in their journey. He recounts the luck of entrepreneurs in America born in the 1850’s (?), Jewish lawyers born in the 1920’s, and software engineers born in the 1950’s. The role of language & culture in airplane crashes, and many more interesting stories that’ll make you appreciate just how random life really is.

4/5.
