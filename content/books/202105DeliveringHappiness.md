A dot-com winner, then loser, then back to the top story. Lots of building-a-business advice from a very unique person. A lot of his focus is on the customer, and internal culture. Sorta changed my perception of what a "head of culture" can even do at a company. Namely, they can facilitate an environment to help people connect, but that could be very different for each person, and at the end of the day, culture is what is *felt* by each person. The collective average being that which is its core, but truly, it's just a feeling.

# Bookmarked ideas

* "Share what you've learned with others."
* "Look for opportunities beyond just the game you sat down to play. You never know who you're going to meet, including new friends for life or new business contacts."
* "Have fun. The game is a lot more enjoyable when you're trying to do more than just make money."
* "[Creating a] culture book is not about the book... it's about the culture."
* "What's the best way to build a brand for the long term? In a word: culture. At Zappos, our belief is that if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff - customer service, long-term brand, etc. will happen naturally"

4/5.
