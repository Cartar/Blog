A masterclass in storytelling. I found it hard to put this book down from start to finish. As the title says, this book follows the evolution of America's bomber mafia, a group of pilots who helped create the Air Force. We learn about their military decisions, shortcomings, success, and the ending of WW2. An interesting story told by one of the greatest storytellers of our time.

5/5.
