A fun reminder of the wonders of our universe, guided by one of the most astonishing minds of the last century. My favourite parts were the forward, introduction, and prelude "why we must ask the big questions", but that is because the reminder of the book reviewed ideas that I'm familiar with. It is remarkable that Stephen could write this book in his last year of life, given his limited ability to express himself (just some facial muscles by that point). That, mixed with his discussions about black holes, the beginning of the universe, and various other areas where our knowledge is incomplete were what made this book worthwhile.

3/5.
