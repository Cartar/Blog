This book has maybe two interesting parts to it. The description of how a new antibiotic was discovered by AI, and the modelling of protein folding by AI. Other than that, the book doesn't go into much detail about AI, and instead focuses on ideas like the cyber threat of AI, and how it is that that cyber threat is different from say nuclear threat. I suppose those would be interesting topics to folks more politically inclined than me. I just wanted to explore cutting edge AI and its novel impacts, which I didn't get from this book.

1/5.
