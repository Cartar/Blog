A short story about what our digital future might hold. We follow an ex-zoo keeper turned digital pet trainer after the zoo she worked at closed down. The world her digi-pet grew up in becomes threatened, and we see the great lengths she'll go, along with a small community of like-minded fanatics, to give these digital humanoids a better future.

2/5.
