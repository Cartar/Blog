With the story well underway, this second book is a masterpiece. Without giving too much away, we are transported to a future where Luo Ji is awake and well. Technology has progressed far enough to give humanity a sense of security, and that leads to some interesting plot development. We finally learn why Luo Ji had so many assassination attempts against him, and yet again, the story unfolds with unanticipated twists that make it hard to put down.

After finishing this book, I understand all the hype. It took me a bit to get into it, but it truly is an incredibly creative story that inspires the reader to see the beauty in our world.

5/5.
