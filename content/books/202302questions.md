A dated book that feels a little ahead of it's time. Certainly still relevant today, it is full of anecdotes about why the 5 questions outlined below are so crucial to success for any organization (private, public, non-profit, etc.). But really, if you agree that the five questions are valuable, you don't need to read the book so much as do the exercise. However, the book is a quick 2 hour read (or less), so you don't lose much giving it a spin!

## Peter Drucker's five questions are:
1. What is our Mission?
2. Who is our Customer?
3. What does the Customer Value?
4. What are our Results?
5. What is our Plan?

3/5.
