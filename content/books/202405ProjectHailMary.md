What a rush. This review won't be detailed to not give away the twists and turns, but from get go, this is a page turner. Our main character wakes with amnesia, allowing the reader to explore this new world alongside him. And of course, our man is a scientist (I say of course because Andy Weir is also the author of the Martian - it's his thing)!

If you like space, science, thrills and a well written book to boot, you can't go wrong picking up this title.

5/5.
