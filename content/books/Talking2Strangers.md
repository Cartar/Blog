Using a mix of data and in-depth investigations around high profile human interactions, where human behaviour is interpreted terribly, we learn some very important lessons. As usual, Malcolm Gladwell deliveries these stories in an engaging book, that was easily devoured. 
 
### My main take aways:

* Defaulting to truth is OK. It is what created our society and it would be stupid to override this companionship generating trait.
* The coupling of environment and action is very strong so strong that it is an aspect of interacting with strangers that should be taken into account companionship generating trait.
    * Don't judge a stranger, judge their environment.
* We are bad lies actors. We expect a liar to act one way and truth tellers another. Snap behaviour from interaction is almost impossible for us to notice.
