"Some people are just born creative"

I'm not yet convinced. People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions, but creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I beleive your environment, life experience, and access to free time (or other resources required for certain creative outlets) are far greater factors.

But who cares what I think, let's find out what science has to say. Specifically, let's review a review: [Research on Workplace Creativity (2000-2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091226).

Starting in the abstract:
```
We observe that although earlier research tended to take
either an actor-centered or a context-centered approach, continuing to
do so may have diminishing returns. To understand creativity in all its
complexity and potential, an interactionist perspective that emphasizes
actor–context interactive effects on creativity holds much promise.
```

Said simply, creativity is best understood through an individual's interaction with their environment.

**At this point, I can either list off facts, or create a story. I should do the later, starting with a wowem of all unexpected results, followed by expected results, into a "putting it all together" bit** Oh, and I should really clean up my intro to better explain what this article is about!


## An Individual's Creativity (*actor-centered*)

The review finds:

* Research is gradually moving toward a more complex understanding of the roots for creativity (e.g., through interactions, indirect effects)
* Studies increasingly involve a joint consideration of actor and context (through concepts that capture actors’ perceptions of, relations to, or positions in their environments, or through situational factors that influence actor-level factors, which in turn influence creativity
* Reliable main effects are hard to find (e.g., none of the Big Five personality factors directly affected creativity)

This all makes sense. Every person is born with the ability to learn a massively wide range of skills and ideas. 

## Reorienting your Environment

* Discuss the Sam Harris podcast AND that UK cyclist coach
* Things you can do:
    * Open space triggers expansive thinking / closed space triggers focus
    * Unfinished space motivates experimentation / clean working spaces encourage perfect 
    * Be clear with yourself which space you want to be in
    * Be clear of the objective; give yourself time to get lost and make new connections
    * Learn from others (ask questions)
    * Try first by yourself

## What is Creativity?
* Most of the best creators of our history are simply people who created the most. 
    * Motzart
    * William Shakespear
    * Nikola Tesla
    * Albert Einstein
    * etc. (find some women and POC)

All had incredible achievements that were highly creative. But they also had many flops. History just doesn't talk about them. 

## How to foster creativity
* Automatic Writing 
* Creativity Process

## Ad hoc thoughts:
Finally, should I be preaching my own experience in creativity? (see reorienting your env ^^^)





## NOTES:
I'd like to give a talk about Creativity. 
The bedrock to innovation and problem solving. 

A little background on why I care in the first place. Obviously at C1 I want to be a top performer, and as an engineer by training, I strongly beleive I can only be a top performer when my team is performing together. 

But beyond C1's walls, I also have found myself with growing responsibility to shape a growing team. -> Juniper! As the head of culture, and the acting leader on our board (which is myself and my 3 founders), part of my repsonsibilities is to make sure we have the best team possible. At every level, from our makers, to our leaders, to my cofounders who lead the team. 

So where to begin... Well, as with many of the new idea's I'm introduced to, this one started from a podcast. ...

* As a backdrop, you should know two things
1. I've recently become interested in what I'm calling "environment engineering"
- it's a bad name, since I'm not referring to environmental engineering, rather the engineering of one's individual environment: rituals, social network, living location, etc. 
- This comes from the same place as many of my favorite idea's: Sam Harris podcasts. Creatures of Habit (https://samharris.org/podcasts/200-creatures-habit/). 38.50 - 42.25 (maybe)?
- My favorite idea from this podcast wasn't necessarily a new one: "habits are the compound interest of self improvement" 
- AND that habits are easy to follow when you design your envionrment around the habits you'd like to form 
- So I wanted to learn more about this guy, and what he had to say about habit building? I loved th
Marginal gains through  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdO4Dd2HZ14&feature=emb_logo)

What I heard from this video was to create power teams, you need to do 4 things: 

* When recruiting top talent, culture fit more imporant than the skill, as the skill can be taught 
* Give ppl ownership 
* Be clear on the problem 
* Create a positive environment

And again, environment! 

If Sir Dave Brailsford is right, it's not that we need to be hiring uber creative savants; we just need to create the right environment. 
And so I did what I used to do, and went to google scholar -> what does the research say? 

Turns out, he's right! Almost... YES (list the obvious yesses)

But there are some surprising findings as well... 

In closing: 
* Habits are the compound interest of self improvement 
* Set up your environment to facilitate good habits 
* Outperforming teams create outperforming environments through top tier leaders 
* Performers are set up for success when they have:
    * Ownership, clear problems and a positive environment (good culture)
* Creativity thrives when:
    * Leadership declares creativity as a goal
    * Desing thinking applied to problem statement generation
    * Diverse teams, with transformational leadership
    * Information sharing is widespread
    ...

Essentially, C1 and specifically the GTA is doing everything right to have a top performing, and creative team.
Keep your eye out for environment engineering opportunuties! 
- Invest more heavily in WFH set up

MY TAKE AWAY:
* Everyone can be creative
* They need to know the goal of any given task
* They need to feel supported by their leader, and trust in them
* The leader needs to actively promote creativity as a desirable goal
* This goal should be a conversation, not a quantified target 
* The leader should display creativity themselves, and be forthcoming with their own struggles, and solutions 
* The culture of the team should resonate with the individual 
* Rewarding creativity can be good, so long as it is routinely (dependably) rewarded 
* Team diversity can stimulate creativity when perspective taking is encouraged and transformational leadership is adopted 
* Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively effected individuals belief in their creativity 
* Low intrinsic motivation reduces ones ability to problem solve creatively 
* Total knowledge on a team is not simply a summation game. The distribution of this knowledge matters, along with leadership mantra, team culture/behaviours, and the individuals creative self-efficacy. 
    * This spills into the question of why we care for creativity at all I think 


Summary:
- It is not enough to simply find “creative individuals”. 
    - In unsupportive contexts, creativity is hard to realize 
- Conversely, managers have the power to create environments that are supportive of creativity, and this environment can be powerful enough to elevate employee’s who lack a natural inclination for creativity. 
- “Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity”

Actor-Centered Accounts of Workplace Creativity
Creativity as an individual outcome.
Some studies following an actor-centered approach to creativity do find factors such as personality, positivity, optimism and creativity-related behaviours; however, other studies failed to find actor-cenetered factors, showing that apart from an openness to experience, none of the Big Five personality factors affected creativity. 

Within the workplace, there has shown to be positive effect on creativity when:
- Positive belief in one’s capacity to perform at their job 
- Highly identified with home and host culture (more than simply home or host culture alone)
    - Host culture = dominant culture in a given area
    - Home culture = culture at home

Intrinsic motivation on creativity (act of being creative without any obvious external rewards) was moderated by prosocial motivation - an individual's desire to benefit other people or groups.

Part of this intrinsic motivation had an indirect effect on creative performance through help seeking. Namely, help seeking benefited creativity! However, prosocial motivation comes at the expense of increased help giving, which negatively affects creativity. 

Higher levers of help giving reduced the positive effect of help seeking on creativity. Basically, creativity can be modulated by restricting the amount of help given, while opening up channels for help seeking. But since help seeking is modulated by prosocial motivation, it is hard for us to seek without reciprocation, and her in lies the double edged sword of prosocial motivation on creativity. 

Creativity as a team outcome
“Gilson & Shalley (2004) found that teams reporting shared goals, participative decision making, a supportive climate, member socializing, and longer organizational tenure of team members also engaged in the creative process to a higher degree”

Some research points to positive creativity due team composition, only when certain member behaviours are on display:
- Individual creativity boosted team creativity only when the team engaged in “team-creativity relevant processes” (i.e., conflict management, team cultural alignment)
- Team diversity boosted creativity only when team members excelled in taking on other’s perspective.
- Positive affective tone (a teams emotion/mood) boosted creativity only when team trust was low and team negative affect tone was previously high.
    - Being on a team with positive affect (emotions / mood), only boosts creativity when your team previously held negative affect and low levels of trust.

Context-Centered Accounts of Workplace Creativity 
This section reflects the continued interest in examining creativity as the result of contextual influences.

Creativity as an individual outcome
* Task dependant.
    * Job control and an ability to apply routine results in self-reported creativity 
    * Moderate levels of time pressure resulting in the highest levels of creativity 
    * Viewing your daily work as challenging is linked to higher levels of daily creativity 
    * If multiple tasks, creativity is optimized when all tasks have goals and users have discretion to switch between tasks 

“The benefit or detriment of external rewards on creativity remains a subject of scholarly debate”
* However, positive effects have been found in future creativity when receiving expected rewards for current creativity -> i.e., follow through with what you say! 

* Supervisors:
    * When expecting creativity, employees perform more creatively. This positive effect was seen when expectations came from coworkers or family and friends too. -> a classic, meeting of the expectation placed upon us by others 
    * Transformational leadership fosters creativity (leaders encourage, inspire and motivate employees to innovate and create change)
    * Leaders sharing their inner struggles, and a broad amount of information leads to trust and positive information sharing which leads to creativity. 
    * Perceived information privacy (again trust) also promoted creativity 
    * Benevolent leadership lead to creativity when autonomy was high, but NOT when job autonomy is low

“the presence of creative coworkers both accentuated the negative effects of supervisor close monitoring on creativity and helped bring out the benefits of supervisor developmental feedback to promote creativity”

* Leadership styles can shape available information within an actors environment
    * The effects of diversity on individuals creativity was only positive when leaders displayed transformational leadership. Otherwise, there was no effect 
    * Individuals expecting an informational evaluation of their ideas performed better in their creativity when given with a standard (or creative) example before working on a task. Conversely, individuals expecting a controlling evaluation of their ideas showed worse levels of creativity when given a standard example compared to no example at all!

* Social network:
    * Centrality + low outside ties leads to higher creativity; and low centrality + high outside ties lead to high creativity. Essentially, not good for you to be someone central to a business with lots of outside ties (makes sense). 

“Leader inspirational motivation on creative effort (an antecedent of creativity) was more positive when leaders were highly prototypical and more negative when leaders were less prototypical”

Creativity as a dyadic or team outcome
“allowing team members to tackle an idea-generation task individually first before engaging in collective ideation led teams to generate ideas of higher quality”

Limitations of Separate Actor- or Context-Centered Accounts
* Before the conditions that encourage creativity can be useful, first, the actor must discover the problem clearly
* Positive effects mentioned such as declaring creativity as a goal or intrinsic motivating do not always yield positive results 

The interplay of positive actor characteristics and supportive contexts
* Different types of context support different actors in the goal of creativity 
    * “benefits of having a moderately sized and highly diverse network of weak ties emerged only for individuals high in openness to experience”
    * At moderate levels of orientation towards learning as a goal, team learning brought out creative benefits; however, individuals with a very high learning goal orientation did not see this positive result 
    * For individuals with creative role identities, creativity was higher than peers with lower creative role identities only if organization support for creativity was perceived. IF that support was perceived to be missing, their creative output was less than their peers. 
    * “informationally diverse teams in the laboratory were more creative after receiving negative feedback, whereas positive feedback promoted the creativity of homogeneous teams”

“George & Zhou (2007) found that negative mood benefited creativity when individuals also had high levels of positive mood and worked in supportive contexts in which supervisors were trustworthy, provided developmental feedback, or displayed interactional justice”

Supervisor support seems highly correlated to many different avenues of creativity…

* Groups who perceived their leader as a role model for creativity also displayed more creativity, but only when their leader engaged in unconventional rather than conventional behaviour. To be creative, you have to do things differently, and watching role models be different triggers that. 

“George & Zhou (2001) found that employees exhibited the highest creativity when they were highly open to experiences, received positive feedback, and worked on tasks with unclear means or ends.”

“Interestingly, and underscoring the need to look at the interplay of the creative actor and the surrounding context, having a trusting relationship with the leader had the opposite impact on the indirect effect of a team’s performance approach orientation on team creativity through information exchange. This effect was more positive when members reported a less-trusting relationship with their leader and more negative when the relationship with the leader was more trusting”

“the effect of demands on creativity was positive when teams had high levels of promotion focus but not when team-level promotion focus was low… this effect emerged only at the individual (but not the team) level of analysis”
* Also, you want moderate levels of competition (low = bad; high = no better than moderate) in fostering creativity within groups with stable membership. However, for groups with new members, the effect of competition on creativity followed a U shape (good at low and high, but bad at moderate). 

Design thinking is important. If you create a problem statement that is too vague, creativity is stifled. Similarly, too narrow, and again, creativity is retarded. 


The interplay of negative actor characteristics and supportive contexts
* Don’t be abusive
* Don’t be a micro managing supervisor 
* Knowledge hiding decreases the actors creativity. “The main and moderated effect of knowledge hiding on the knowledge hider’s creativity was mediated by distrust of another person and in turn that person’s own knowledge hiding”


“one key takeaway from this review is that uniform main effects are rare, such open-ended classification is likely to apply to a broader range of factors beyond the structural variables of time or project phase ”
“our review suggests that leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity. Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity.”
“Studying the manifold ways in which actors and contexts jointly impact the creativity of employees and work groups remains a challenge for future organizational research”


LOL: “The limited number of factors studied at both levels [individual and team] of analysis renders premature a general conclusion as to whether creativity is an isomorphous construct across levels of analysis that displays homologous relations with a broad range of antecedents”


“
For factors of the same valence, we suggest that a number of interaction types cover the range of results from prior research. The first comprises cases in which two factors with individually positive effects/potential jointly affect an individual in such a way that their positive effects are mutually enhanced in a synergistic way. An example is Zhang & Bartol’s (2010) account of how psychological empowerment had a stronger positive effect on creative process engagement (which in turn predicted creativity) when leaders strongly encouraged creativity, but a weaker, but still positive, effect when this encouragement was weak. In other cases, the positive moderating factor may be needed to activate the benefit of the independent variable. For instance, Richter et al. (2012) found that the effect of individual self-efficacy on creativity was contingent both on the knowledge resources available to the team and on an adequate meta-cognitive representation of its distribution. Conversely, in interactions involving two negative factors, the moderator may increase the detrimental effect of the independent variable, thus working in an antagonistic mode. An example of mutually reinforcing negative factors is the interaction between abusive supervision and attributed injury initiation motives reported by Liu et al. (2012). The effect of abusive supervision on creativity was particularly detrimental when individuals saw the abuse as reflecting their leaders’ intent to inflict harm.

Alternatively, a moderator that shares the same basic effect on creativity as the independent variable may create boundary conditions for the effect of the independent variable. When the independent variable and the moderator are (potentially) positive, the result is a pattern that can be described as diminishing gains. An example of this pattern is Madjar and colleagues’ (2002) finding that nonwork support for creativity had a positive effect for employees with low levels of creative personality but provided little additional value for employees with high levels of creative personality. Conversely, interactions involving independent variables and moderators that have a (potentially) negative effect may result in a pattern in which the independent variable has no additional negative effect on creativity at low levels of the moderator, thus yielding a pattern of diminishing losses. An example of this pattern is Hirst and coauthors’ (2011) finding that the negative effects of performance avoid goal orientation emerged at low levels of formalization, but not when formalization was high, that is, with explicit rules on how to act for all actors
