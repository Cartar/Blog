> Creativity is something you're born with.

I call bull shit. People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions. But creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I beleive your environment, past life experience, and access to free time (or other resources required for certain creative outlets) are far greater factors.

But who cares what I think, let's find out what science has to say. Specifically, let's review a review: [Research on Workplace Creativity (2000-2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091226).

Starting in the abstract:
> "We observe that although earlier research tended to take
either an actor-centered or a context-centered approach, continuing to
do so may have diminishing returns. To understand creativity in all its
complexity and potential, an interactionist perspective that emphasizes
actor–context interactive effects on creativity holds much promise."

Said simply, creativity is best understood through an individual's interaction with their environment.

Not just somthing you're born with after all! Anyone can be, be more, and be amazingly creative.

## Creativity at the Workplace

Let us first pause, and consider if creativity at the workplace is a good proxy for creativity as a whole? Go ahead, think for yourself - is it?

{{< figure src="/images/workplace-creativity.jpg" >}}

I believe it is a valuable proxy whenever creativity is needed within a team, and that team has some financial incentive in their delivery. However, creativity as a solo show, or within a team without financial ends, *could* have different considerations, or simply not map onto these points. However, many of the points here are general, and seem like they *should* deliver value outside of the workplace too. 

All this to say, this research isn't an absolute truth for all circumstances.

## The Obvious 
A lot of the research had, in my opinion, obvious findings. But let's not skip these points. It's all too easy to get caught up in the nuanced or corner case findings, forgetting that the basics can get us where we needed to be. Let's see some of these points listed out:

* "Leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativty" (*duh*).
    * Trustworthy leaders build team creativity.
* All tasks should be given goals (but not too focused - use design thinking).
* Have positive belief in one’s capacity to perform their job.
* Autonomy is key (do not micro manage - again, *duh*).
* Moderate time pressure is good.
* “Allowing team members to tackle an idea-generation task individually first, before engaging in collective ideation led teams to generate ideas of higher quality”

So this is a nice list of things to do, but what about things not to do? Unfortunately, the review didn't touch much on that research because, well, how to *supress* creativity isn't well studied. I guess there isn't much money in it? Go figure :shrug: However, there is one study mentioned. It showed knowledge hiding decreases an individuals creativity. 

> “The main and moderated effect of knowledge hiding on the knowledge hider’s creativity was mediated by distrust of another person and in turn that person’s own knowledge hiding”.

In other words, do onto others as you'd have them do onto you. You hid information from them, they'll hid it from you.

TODO: (maybe)
- design thinking (task dependant):
    * Job control and an ability to apply routine results in self-reported creativity 
    * Moderate levels of time pressure resulting in the highest levels of creativity 
    * Viewing your daily work as challenging is linked to higher levels of daily creativity 
    * If multiple tasks, creativity is optimized when all tasks have goals and users have discretion to switch between tasks 

## The Nuanced
Okay, so far, we've basically reminded ourselves why culture matters; why it benefits a team to have strong leadership, not micro manage, and be kind to ourselves and others. Probably all things that have a possitive affect outside of creativity too. What are some more nuanced findings brought to light by this review?

For starters, there are a few recommendations for leaders:
* Leaders sharing their inner struggles, and a broad amount of information leads to trust and positive information sharing, which leads to creativity.
* “Leader inspirational motivation on creative effort (an antecedent of creativity) was more positive when leaders were highly prototypical, and more negative when leaders were less prototypical”.
* Leaders thought of as creative role model can boost creativity by displaying unconventional behaviour.
* Creativity should be declared as a desirable outcome.
    * When expecting creativity, employees perform more creatively. This positive effect was seen when expectations came from coworkers or family and friends too. A classic example of meeting the expectation placed upon us by others.

Two of my favourite take aways here showcase how true it is that we are social creatures. That creative expectations placed on us by others, and leaders displaying unconventional behaviour both improve our creativty shows how much our minds are fueled by those around us.

Beyond useful tips for people leadership, there are some team values that can foster creativity:

* Team diversity boosted creativity only when team members excelled in taking on other’s perspective.
    * Create a diverse team, AND a culture of listening to idea's that aren't yours, and maybe oppose your beliefs.
* Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively affected individuals belief in their creativity.
* [Transformational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_leadership) helps to unlock creativity in general, and is necessary to unlock creativity benefits brought on by diversity.
* Reward those who benefit others; "prosocial motivation" moderates intrinsic motiviation for creativity.
    * Part of this motivation comes from a culture of help seeking.
    * However, prosocial motivation comes at the expense of increased help giving, which negatively affects creativity.

Here we see a general theme arise. Having an environment where new ideas flow easily, free from echo chambers or dogmatic beliefs, elevates creativity for everyone involved. However, fall prey to close mindedness or stop listening to new ideas, and you're sure to take a hit to your creativity.

## The Context
So far, these recommendations have been generally applicable. What about those "actor–context" findings mentioned in the paper's abstract? How might the same context affect people differently? 

For example, the interplay of context and the individual leads to positive, or negative, or a mute impact on creativity. Let's take a look:

* Benevolent leadership lead to creativity when autonomy was high, but NOT when job autonomy is low.
* For individuals with creative role identities (i.e., believing your results are delivered in part due to creative thinking), creativity was higher than peers only if organization support for creativity was perceived. If that support was perceived to be missing, their creative output was actually less than their peers.
* Individuals expecting an informational evaluation of their ideas performed better in their creativity when given a standard (or creative) example before working on a task. Conversely, individuals expecting a controlling evaluation of their ideas showed worse levels of creativity when given a standard example compared to no example at all!
* Moderate levels of competition fostered creativity within groups with stable membership (low levels of competition were bad, and high levels were no better than moderate). However, for groups that change frequently with new members, the effect of competition on creativity followed a U shape (good at low and high, but bad at moderate).
* To optimize creativity via social networks, you either want: i) high centrality and low outside ties, or ii) low centrality and high outside ties.

These examples highlight the need to consider each person, or their team, separately when trying to improve creativity. There is no "one size fits all" solution here, as we'd expect.

Additional research will shed light on trade-offs for team's trying to optimize heavily in one dimension. For example, trusting relationships with leaders has a positive effect for team creativity with a learning goal orientation, through infromation exchange. However, if instead of a learning goal orientation, your team has a performance approach orientation, this same mechanism (information exchange + trust in leadership) actually results in a negative impact to creativity. Interestingly, this double-edged sword works in reverse as well, where less-trusting relationships with leadership had a positive impact on team creativity with performance approach orientation.

> Gong and colleagues (2012b) showed that having a trusting relationship with the leader moderated the indirect effect of team learning goal orientation on team creativity through team information exchange such that this indirect effect was positive when teams had a trusting relationship with their leaders, but it was not significant when trust was low. Interestingly, and underscoring the need to look at the interplay of the creative actor and the surrounding context, having a trusting relationship with the leader had the opposite impact on the indirect effect of a team’s performance approach orientation on team creativity through information exchange. This effect was more positive when members reported a less-trusting relationship with their leader and more negative when the relationship with the leader was more trusting.

## Environment Engineering 
Clearly, the context which we find ourselves, or those we're evaluating, is an integral part to success. This shouldn't come as a surprise. The more we've learnt about human behaviour, the more we understand how crucial one's environment is to shaping who we are. As I mention in my take aways to Malcom Gladwell's book "Talking to Strangers", *Don’t judge a stranger, judge their environment.*.

Empowered by this idea, we can purposely shape our environments for the better. Allowing our context to deliver value day after day. I call this Environment Engineering (not to be confused with Environmental Engineering, although I do see the problem I've created for myself).

At a personal level, there is a ton of low hanging fruit anyone can do. For example, removing distrations from your environment can greatly improve focus by eliminating context switching. Try keeping your phone out of reach, with notifications off for everything except maybe phone calls or other possibly urgent forms of commmunication. Mute notifications for everything else. Or try working in an open space to fuel expansive thinking (a quiet park if your living arrangement cannot provide). If focus is what you need, maybe a closed-off dark room is preferable. Recognizing when you need to be alone, with your own thoughts, or together, sharing ideas, is another big environment change you can make. 

Try creating purposeful stress modulating reminders in your environment. Mindfulness meditation, and certain breathing exercises can quickly change your stress levels if they are unwantingly high. At times of unwanted stress, it can be hard to bring these tricks into the present moment. Maybe a poster, or a note, or a peice of artwork help ground you in times of unwanted stress. Make sure your environment has these reminders, and you have practice using them. 

As an aside, if you're new to mindful meditation as a tool for stress management, I suggest trying the [Waking Up meditation app](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/redeemMonth/ff5831). If you're unsure what breathing exercises to do, review Andrew Huberman's work.

## Do Not Overlook the 1% Improvement
Another reason to try environment engineering is for self improvement. As discussed by James Clear on the Sam Harris podcast, habits are the compounding interest of self improvement. What are habits? They are the moment-by-moment decisions we make. How are decisions made? They are often the simplest choice to a current dilemma. What determines the simplest choice? The simplest choice is a function of your environment. Therefore, self improvement begins with improving your environment.

Let's take Sir Dave Brailsford as an example, the man behind Britain's dominance in cycling over the past 2 decades. He improved the obvious:
- Aerodynamics of suits 
- Weight of the bikes
- Biotracking during fitness routines to optimize for the individual the next day

Above and beyond:
- Painting the inside of their bike transportation truck white to help spot dirt on bikes
- All bikers A/B tested over 30 pillows so everyone had the perfect pillow they could take with them to events 
- Hiring surgeons to teach the team proper hand washing technique to reduce sickness


Marginal change:

What I heard from this video was to create power teams, you need to do 4 things: 
* During recruitment, focus on behavioural fit more than technical prowess (culture fit)
* Give people ownership (autonomy)
* Be clear on the problem (Design thinking)
* Create a positive environment (strong leadership)




## In closing 
Context changes:
- Incentize information sharing, open mindedness, and seeking of diverse idea's for teams that have creative role identiy.
- Incentivize their leaders to be vulnerable, sharing and genuine to build trust between the leaders and the makers.
- Invest in transformational leadership & leaders who can craft clear goals with design thinking


* Everyone can be creative
- It is not enough to simply find “creative individuals”. 
    - In unsupportive contexts, creativity is hard to realize 
- Conversely, managers have the power to create environments that are supportive of creativity, and this environment can be powerful enough to elevate employee’s who lack a natural inclination for creativity. 
- “Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity”


* Habits are the compound interest of self improvement 
* Set up your environment to facilitate good habits 
* Outperforming teams create outperforming environments through top tier leaders 
* Performers are set up for success when they have:
    * Ownership, clear problems and a positive environment (good culture)

* Creativity thrives when:    
    * Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively effected individuals belief in their creativity 
    * Total knowledge on a team is not simply a summation game. The distribution of this knowledge matters, along with leadership mantra, team culture/behaviours, and the individuals creative self-efficacy. 
    * Desing thinking applied to problem statement generation
    * They need to feel supported by their leader, and trust in them
    * The leader needs to actively promote creativity as a desirable goal
        * This goal should be a conversation, not a quantified target 
    * The leader should display creativity themselves, and be forthcoming with their own struggles, and solutions 



“one key takeaway from this review is that uniform main effects are rare, such open-ended classification is likely to apply to a broader range of factors beyond the structural variables of time or project phase ”
“our review suggests that leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity. Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity.”
“Studying the manifold ways in which actors and contexts jointly impact the creativity of employees and work groups remains a challenge for future organizational research”


And connect all of this withhhhhhh remote workplace. How the 5th level of remote workplace, office nirvana, is a key to unlocking top creativity. There are of course risks, as optimized creativity is different for everyone, and certain people may conflate with each other, BUT the local maximum of creativity for a team will likely live in a zone of workplace nirvana. 


### Appendix:
My favourite run on sentence... gotta love peer reviewed literature:

> “The limited number of factors studied at both levels [individual and team] of analysis renders premature a general conclusion as to whether creativity is an isomorphous construct across levels of analysis that displays homologous relations with a broad range of antecedents”


*TODO, SPRUCE UP THE ARTICLE WITH EMOJI'S AND PICTURES :D*
