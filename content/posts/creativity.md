> Creativity is something you're born with.

I call bull shit. People are certainly born with a wide range of genetic dispositions. But creativity, IMO, is rather low on that list. I beleive your environment, past life experience, and access to free time (or other resources required for certain creative outlets) are far greater factors.

But who cares what I think, let's find out what science has to say. Specifically, let's review a review: [Research on Workplace Creativity (2000-2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-031413-091226).

Starting in the abstract:
> "We observe that although earlier research tended to take
either an actor-centered or a context-centered approach, continuing to
do so may have diminishing returns. To understand creativity in all its
complexity and potential, an interactionist perspective that emphasizes
actor–context interactive effects on creativity holds much promise."

Said simply, creativity is best understood through an individual's interaction with their environment.

Not just somthing you're born with after all! Anyone can be, be more, and be amazingly creative.

## Everyone has the capacity to be creative

Let's start by looking at the paper's findings split into two categories: i) intuitive and ii) Nuanced.

Intuitive | Nuanced
--- | ---
"Leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativty" | Leaders should **actively promote creativity as a desired outcome**
All tasks should be given goals * | **Transformational leadership** helps to unlock creativity, and is **necessary to unlock the benefits of diversity**
Autonomy is key / do not micro manage (*duh*) | Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively affected individuals belief in their creativity
Moderate time pressure | Rewarding creativity works, but only on subsequent problems post reward delivery
Trustworthy leaders builds team creativity ** | Leaders thought of as creative role model can boost creativity by displaying unconventional behaviour

*Note:* this isn't an exhaustive list, there are some findings I have omitted here for brevity. i.e., culture fit is important, ... *TODO: ADD OTHER SIMPLE THINGS LEFT OUT OF THIS LIST*
- Positive belief in one’s capacity to perform at their job 
- “Gilson & Shalley (2004) found that teams reporting shared goals, participative decision making, a supportive climate, member socializing, and longer organizational tenure of team members also engaged in the creative process to a higher degree”


\* (but not too focused - design thinking)

\** i) be forthcoming with their own struggles; ii) perceived information privacy promotes creativity

This table is a list of things to do, but what about a list of things not to do? Unfortunately, the review didn't touch much on that research because, well, how to supress creativity isn't well studied. I guess there isn't much money in it? Go figure :shrug:

Having said this, there is one study mentioned. It showed that knowledge hiding decreases the individuals creativity. “The main and moderated effect of knowledge hiding on the knowledge hider’s creativity was mediated by distrust of another person and in turn that person’s own knowledge hiding”. In other words, do onto others as you'd have them do onto you. You hid information from them, they'll hid it from you.

Given that one's perception of their creativty is amplified by knowing information is shared, and who they can go to for it, knowledge hiding is doubly harmful. All of this probably falls in the "intuitive" category of things to be aware of; however, I can't understand why there still exist companies that willingly create incentive structures that pit internal teams or individuals against each other, thus incentivizing knowledge hiding.

If you uncover incentives that effectively stifle communication, perhaps unintentionally, raise the alarm! Those incentives will kill creativity.


## Why focus on incentives?

#### Reorienting your Environment

* Discuss the Sam Harris podcast AND that UK cyclist coach
* Things you can do:
    * Open space triggers expansive thinking / closed space triggers focus
    * Unfinished space motivates experimentation / clean working spaces encourage perfect 
    * Be clear with yourself which space you want to be in
    * Be clear of the objective; give yourself time to get lost and make new connections
    * Learn from others (ask questions)
    * Try first by yourself
- My favorite idea from this podcast wasn't necessarily a new one: "habits are the compound interest of self improvement" 
- AND that habits are easy to follow when you design your envionrment around the habits you'd like to form 
- So I wanted to learn more about this guy, and what he had to say about habit building? I loved th
Marginal gains through  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdO4Dd2HZ14&feature=emb_logo)

What I heard from this video was to create power teams, you need to do 4 things: 
* During recruitment, focus on behavioural fit more than technical prowess (culture fit)
* Give people ownership (autonomy)
* Be clear on the problem (Design thinking)
* Create a positive environment (strong leadership)


And again, environment! 

If Sir Dave Brailsford is right, it's not that we need to be hiring uber creative savants; we just need to create the right environment. 
And so I did what I used to do, and went to google scholar -> what does the research say? 



## What are good incentives?



## Need to flush out this section...
But there are some surprising findings as well... 

In closing: 
* Habits are the compound interest of self improvement 
* Set up your environment to facilitate good habits 
* Outperforming teams create outperforming environments through top tier leaders 
* Performers are set up for success when they have:
    * Ownership, clear problems and a positive environment (good culture)
* Creativity thrives when:
    * Leadership declares creativity as a goal
    * Desing thinking applied to problem statement generation
    * Diverse teams, with transformational leadership
    * Information sharing is widespread
    ...


MY TAKE AWAY:
* Everyone can be creative
* They need to know the goal of any given task
* They need to feel supported by their leader, and trust in them
* The leader needs to actively promote creativity as a desirable goal
* This goal should be a conversation, not a quantified target 
* The leader should display creativity themselves, and be forthcoming with their own struggles, and solutions 
* The culture of the team should resonate with the individual 
* Rewarding creativity can be good, so long as it is routinely (dependably) rewarded 
* Team diversity can stimulate creativity when perspective taking is encouraged and transformational leadership is adopted 
* Information sharing and team wide understanding of who knows what (especially in diverse teams) positively effected individuals belief in their creativity 
* Low intrinsic motivation reduces ones ability to problem solve creatively 
* Total knowledge on a team is not simply a summation game. The distribution of this knowledge matters, along with leadership mantra, team culture/behaviours, and the individuals creative self-efficacy. 
    * This spills into the question of why we care for creativity at all I think 


Summary:
- It is not enough to simply find “creative individuals”. 
    - In unsupportive contexts, creativity is hard to realize 
- Conversely, managers have the power to create environments that are supportive of creativity, and this environment can be powerful enough to elevate employee’s who lack a natural inclination for creativity. 
- “Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity”

Summary of good incentives to create:
- reward those who benefit others: "prosocial motivation" moderates intrinsic motiviation for creativity
    - part of this motivation comes from a culture of help seeking.
    - However, prosocial motivation comes at the expense of increased help giving, which negatively affects creativity.
        - her in lies the double edged sword of prosocial motivation on creativity. 
- Team diversity boosted creativity only when team members excelled in taking on other’s perspective.
    - Create a diverse team, AND a culture of listening to idea's that aren't yours, and maybe oppose your beliefs. 
- design thinking (task dependant):
    * Job control and an ability to apply routine results in self-reported creativity 
    * Moderate levels of time pressure resulting in the highest levels of creativity 
    * Viewing your daily work as challenging is linked to higher levels of daily creativity 
    * If multiple tasks, creativity is optimized when all tasks have goals and users have discretion to switch between tasks 
- Supervisors:
    * When expecting creativity, employees perform more creatively. This positive effect was seen when expectations came from coworkers or family and friends too. -> a classic, meeting of the expectation placed upon us by others 
    * Transformational leadership fosters creativity (leaders encourage, inspire and motivate employees to innovate and create change)
    * Leaders sharing their inner struggles, and a broad amount of information leads to trust and positive information sharing which leads to creativity. 
    * Perceived information privacy (again trust) also promoted creativity 
    * Benevolent leadership lead to creativity when autonomy was high, but NOT when job autonomy is low
- Individuals expecting an informational evaluation of their ideas performed better in their creativity when given with a standard (or creative) example before working on a task. Conversely, individuals expecting a controlling evaluation of their ideas showed worse levels of creativity when given a standard example compared to no example at all!
* Social network:
    * Centrality + low outside ties leads to higher creativity; and low centrality + high outside ties lead to high creativity. Essentially, not good for you to be someone central to a business with lots of outside ties (makes sense). 
- “Leader inspirational motivation on creative effort (an antecedent of creativity) was more positive when leaders were highly prototypical and more negative when leaders were less prototypical”
- “allowing team members to tackle an idea-generation task individually first before engaging in collective ideation led teams to generate ideas of higher quality”
* Groups who perceived their leader as a role model for creativity also displayed more creativity, but only when their leader engaged in unconventional rather than conventional behaviour. To be creative, you have to do things differently, and watching role models be different triggers that. 


## CAUTION OF how individuals and thier context play out!
The interplay of positive actor characteristics and supportive contexts
* Different types of context support different actors in the goal of creativity 
    * “benefits of having a moderately sized and highly diverse network of weak ties emerged only for individuals high in openness to experience”
    * At moderate levels of orientation towards learning as a goal, team learning brought out creative benefits; however, individuals with a very high learning goal orientation did not see this positive result 
    * For individuals with creative role identities, creativity was higher than peers with lower creative role identities only if organization support for creativity was perceived. IF that support was perceived to be missing, their creative output was less than their peers. 
    * “informationally diverse teams in the laboratory were more creative after receiving negative feedback, whereas positive feedback promoted the creativity of homogeneous teams”
---
“Interestingly, and underscoring the need to look at the interplay of the creative actor and the surrounding context, having a trusting relationship with the leader had the opposite impact on the indirect effect of a team’s performance approach orientation on team creativity through information exchange. This effect was more positive when members reported a less-trusting relationship with their leader and more negative when the relationship with the leader was more trusting”

“the effect of demands on creativity was positive when teams had high levels of promotion focus but not when team-level promotion focus was low… this effect emerged only at the individual (but not the team) level of analysis”
* Also, you want moderate levels of competition (low = bad; high = no better than moderate) in fostering creativity within groups with stable membership. However, for groups with new members, the effect of competition on creativity followed a U shape (good at low and high, but bad at moderate).

## In closing:

“one key takeaway from this review is that uniform main effects are rare, such open-ended classification is likely to apply to a broader range of factors beyond the structural variables of time or project phase ”
“our review suggests that leadership plays a key role in forming a supportive context for creativity. Hence, organizations should train their managers to exhibit the type of leadership or supervisory behaviors that nurture instead of inhibit employee creativity.”
“Studying the manifold ways in which actors and contexts jointly impact the creativity of employees and work groups remains a challenge for future organizational research”


And connect all of this withhhhhhh remote workplace. How the 5th level of remote workplace, office nirvana, is a key to unlocking top creativity. There are of course risks, as optimized creativity is different for everyone, and certain people may conflate with each other, BUT the local maximum of creativity for a team will likely live in a zone of workplace nirvana. 


### Appendix:
My favourite run on sentence... gotta love peer reviewed literature:

> “The limited number of factors studied at both levels [individual and team] of analysis renders premature a general conclusion as to whether creativity is an isomorphous construct across levels of analysis that displays homologous relations with a broad range of antecedents”


*TODO, SPRUCE UP THE ARTICLE WITH EMOJI'S AND PICTURES :D*
