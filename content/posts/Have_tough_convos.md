Suppose you aren’t happy with how a housemate leaves the kitchen, or maybe they take up too much shared living space, and you’d like them to pay a little more if they want to keep owning the space. 

Or maybe you’re upset by the amount of equity a partner has in your joint venture? 

Maybe your boyfriend or girlfriend doesn’t …

Whatever the tough conversation is, have it now. If you do not, there are only 2 possible outcomes:

1. You drift apart from that person & your relationship with them, and so never having brought up the conversations is actually a good thing.
2. You do not drift apart, and the tough conversations lingers. Each new month, and passing year makes the conversation harder to have, as the examples of frustration mount. The distance between your opinion, and theirs widens, and the larger a compromise is required of both you and them to arrive at a common ground.

So assuming you’re not planning to drift apart, have the conversation now. Or better yet, have the conversation BEFORE there even is a problem! 

Moving into a new place with a friend? Set out expectations on cleanliness, chores, responsibilities, AND repercussions! A simple one might be that you’ll have to move out if they don’t keep the kitchen clean. Is that a big deal? Not if you say up front, BEFORE you’ve moved in together. 

Or how about that partner with more equity? Before assigning equity, be sure to agree on a structure that is flexible to future work output. To agree upfront that X percent goes to you, and Y to them, makes it hard to adjust for output over time. This is an idea discussed further in (THAT BOOK NIKITA HAD!?)
