Suppose you aren’t happy with how a housemate leaves the kitchen, or maybe they take up too much shared living space, and you’d like them to pay a little more if they want to keep owning the space.
 
Maybe your significant other hides financial information from you, and you're feeling the onset of financial abuse?
 
Whatever the tough conversation is, have it now. If you do not, there are only 2 possible outcomes:
 
1. You drift apart from that person. Your relationship ends, so never having brought up the conversations is actually OK. It didn't matter.
2. You do not drift apart, and the tough conversations lingers. Each new month, and passing year makes the conversation harder to have, as the frustration mounts. The distance between your opinion and theirs widens, and the larger a compromise is required of both you and them to arrive at a common ground.
 
So assuming you’re not planning to drift apart, have the conversation now. Or better yet, have the conversation **before** there even is a problem!
