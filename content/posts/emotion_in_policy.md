What value does emotion add to our conversations about other people? Obviously, emotion makes conversation between us, well, human. But, where does emotion get us when we're making decisions *for* others? And not just missing from the room, but others in large quantity? What is the value of emotion, when we're making decisions for an organization, a city, a country, or the world? 

There clearly isn't a black or white answer to this question. But I think this exercise, asking ourselves what value our emotions bring to decisions about many others, is worth thinking about.

## Listening to others
When we're having conversations, emotions can be as powerful as the words themselves. Tone can differentiate comedy from cruelty, and love from like. It can stay with us, change us, in a way an emotionless conversation cannot. 

Clearly, emotion is a valuable asset to good conversation. It directs our attention in powerful ways.

## Conversations about policy 
The conversations about decisions that affect many people are never easy. Sometimes, a decision that most positivly impacts others coincides with the most fiscally responsible. But most of the time, there is a trade off. Spend resources / make a change to the system here, to eventually gain something there. 

The larger the impact of the decision, the longer these conversations take (usually). This is why large companies move slow & start ups move fast. And also why governments take so long to make change. 

## Using our emotion
Since we are humans making decisions for other humans, there will always be biases at the table. A healthy conversation will acknowledge this, and try its best to reduce bias. But our cognative bias is a nasty bugger. Even if we pay attention to possible *gotcha's* in our minds-eye, our subconcious will apply our bias to our emotions. To remove our bias, we need to turn off our emotions.

## Can we hear you?
Without emotion, we're at a table where everyone's opinion can change. Without bias, everyone should be a better listener. But without emotion, how well will we hear new idea's? Can we empathize properly if we've turned off our emotional antennas? 

## The value of emotion in policy
Let us listen with emotion, hear what is being said, and understand as many legitamite viewpoints as possible. 

Let us decide without emotion, knowing we've made a choice without (much) bias, and a clear head.
