## WIP

* Talking with Ryan, I realize that I am happiest when I'm adding value directly to other people. Teaching folks what they want to learn is an example; providing them a useful tool is another.
* When thinking about creating value for myself, I often focus on wealth creation. I'm not sure why TBH. One guess is that more wealth allows me to place bigger bets, and subsequently more wealth creation. However, it is a fools errand to think there is a goal here. There is no winning in wealth creation, and the reward system is built on taking risks, which'll include losses.
* Business value is generated by providing society something it is willing to pay for, or purchasing goods worth more tomorrow than you paid today. 
* Societal value is the improvement of our lives. This means something different for everyone, but generally boils down to happiness/health/wealth and sex.
* Finding work that intersects these value systems is incredibly tricky.
    * My masters didn't check any of the boxes, although it did teach me a lot.
    * Juniper was primarily business value, and not enough personal/societal value - although the jury is not out on that one yet!
