Happiness is subjective. Yet, I've noticed some patterns that are hopefully worthwhile to understand.

1. What brings us happiness changes over time. In our childhood, it is freetime (aka play time). In our middle age, it becomes progress. In old age I'm honestly not sure what brings people happiness. Maybe it is their lifes wisdom that brings them happiness, aka, every moment you're mind is still working :shrug:.

2. Progress is only half the story. The other half is love. Loving someone deeply, and knowing they love you is all one needs to be happy. The Shakespearian love. However, not everyone can attain such a strong love. Once it becomes clear that you'll be living a life without Shakespearian love, your focus becomes *capaitalistic* in nature. Love that places the emphasis on how you look, rather than who you are. This love can often (but not always) be bought. This love is very different from Shakespearian. Society sells us the story that both can be atained, and for a lucky few, that is true. But for most, you go down either path...
