Understanding human psychology can profoundly change your life. That you, and everyone you've met have multiple versions of their self (let's call these "self-states"), is why you should never be too hard on humans. 

Control over one's self-states is a commonality between high-performing individuals. Lacking the ability to move betweeen appropriate states of self is often viewed quite negatively by society, but it shouldn't be. It should be viewed compassionately, with solutions rather than ridicule or anger. Psychedelics are showing promise as one potential tool for such people. The creation of new habits through environmental design could be another.

For example, a customizable "mood rings" linked to our phones could serve to reinforce our desired self-states by modifying our physical, digital, and emotional states all at once. Other physical objects could accomplish a similar task, however rings are discrete, highly personizable, and easily removed. Removing the ring would be equivalent to muting your phone. Having it on would constitute a self-state you're engaged with. Working, socializing, creativity, play, listening, etc.
