Very interesting podcast about how revolutions, changes in society that affect every part of society, are reliant on investement. And, how invest into "the next revolution" isn't available until the past revolution no longer delivers strong capital gains. 

Some of the mentioned past revolutions were the industrial (coal/oil, massive engineering, steel, electricity, etc.), the telephone, and the internet. Interestingly, it is quite hard for the winners of past revolutions to create the next one, because of how many large fixed costs rely on the current revolution. For example, AT&T was pitched the internet (a decentralized connection node network) before it was prototyped by the US military. They simply couldn't understand how creating a decentralized network would be profitable, given their monopoloy of a closed network. Similarly, IBM, in their infancy, thought the entire world would only need 3 computers to complete the various "computer needs". IBM was stuck in the electrical revolution, without realizing the world-wide-web was around the corner. 

So, what is the next revolution to the internet? Well, you can be sure it'll take up a lot of capital, and that it won't receive funding until the internet and it's subsequent technological advancements / capital gains are dried up. 

That may seem ways away, but I believe it is already here. Most innovation joins multiple pieces of the complex global resources of "things" together. The internet could not happen without first the telephone, nor the telephone without first the industrial revolution, and so on. Think about all the funds currently directed to drastically changing transportation (space, underground travel, electric cars - basically, everything Musk), communication (also Musk with Neurolink; or the various attempts of quantum computers), energy (fusion & other renewables), fincance (block-chain), or medicine (?).

Revolutions are made by connecting existing idea's with a sales pitch that provides explosive levels of investment, AND return. Bets are currently being placed, and new bets will continue to be placed, until the next revolution is clear.

Personally, I think the next revolution is in AR/VR. Only time will tell!
