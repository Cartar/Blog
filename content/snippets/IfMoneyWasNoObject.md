I love this question. I'll often come back to it in moments of quiteness, maybe on vacation. And although my answer changes, it is never "what I'm currently doing".

My stance on this question is worth a closer look. Why haven't I lived a life without money focus? I'd probably be more content with life if I did. But I'd also be a totally different person than who I am.

Being money focused isn't inherantly bad if your society values money. I'd say it's a crucial component to success. Money is a resource, and managing your resources is a part of living a healthy life. Without resource managment, you run the risk of bad times when the going gets tough.

I digress. If having some focus on money is good, is it that I put *too* much focus there? Maybe. But until my answer is "yes", I'll remain unconcerned.

So if my focus (let's start calling this my mental energy, or simply energy) is OK, but my answer is not yet "what I'm currently doing", what's going on? Well, I hope someday I'll be wealthy enough to have that be my answer, but right now I don't *feel* wealthy enough. 

OK, so what is "wealthy enough"? And if my favourite song lyrics are true, maybe I am wealthy enough right now?

```
Treasure is,
Measured
In units of love.
Which means you may find,
You are rich.
Beyond you're wildest dreams.
```

"Treasure" by Above and Beyond, in case you're wondering. 

Again, I digress. Is my wealth **enough**? I agree with the lyrics that love is more meaningful than wealth. But I also have some life goals that require more than just love.
