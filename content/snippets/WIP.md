## Death
Death is life's greatest invention. It keeps our moments numbered in our love finite. 

You never know when you'll be doing some thing for the last time. But everything that you do will be done for the last time. This can be a very powerful realization. Every bad moment or negative thought is fleeting. No matter how many times can you enter that state there will eventually be a last time. The goal, of course, is to have a few of the bad moments while maximizing the good. And while there are always trade-offs between pleasure now, or later, the goal is not to be the richest person in the cemetary. 

```txt
Life is something that happens in a flash.
We just have a brief moment here,
and then we're gone.
